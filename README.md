# FFB-Glove

This is low cost 3D printed force-feedback glove powered by ESP32 intended to provide more immersion for VR application. It has one servo motor and 1 DOF tracking for each finger, allowing players to grab and feel objects inside of a VR environment.

This project is inspired by and derived from [Lucid Gloves](https://github.com/LucidVR/lucidgloves), [Proto Glove](https://github.com/Valsvirtuals/ProtoGlove) and [ZipLine](https://github.com/Valsvirtuals/ZipLine).

I love the rack and pinion system of the Proto 5, zip tie system of the zipline, more ergonomic base of the Proto Glove, and slimness of the linear potentiometer. So I designed this glove to combine everything I love together.

This project in its current state is not as polished as the aforementioned projects. A lot of the assembling will need to be improvised, e.g. there is no mounting mechanism and the parts will need to be assembled using glue/double-sided tape.
