# FFB-Glove

This project is inspired by and derived from [Lucid Gloves](https://github.com/LucidVR/lucidgloves), [Proto Glove](https://github.com/Valsvirtuals/ProtoGlove) and [ZipLine](https://github.com/Valsvirtuals/ZipLine).

I love the rack and pinion system of the Proto 5, zip tie system of the zipline, more ergonomic base of the Proto Glove, and slimness of the linear potentiometer. So I tried to combine everything together into one glove.

This project in its current state is not as polished as the aforementioned projects. A lot of the assembling will need to be improvised, e.g. there is no mounting mechanism and the parts will need to be assembled using glue/double-sided tape.
